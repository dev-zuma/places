# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Worldwide Chase** is a geography-themed detective game where players solve crime cases by identifying connected locations based on thematic clues and progressively revealed visual evidence. Each case features AI-generated villains, crime narratives, and educational geography content presented in an authentic detective case file interface. This is a production-ready web application built with modern technologies.

The game now features **two distinct formats**:
- **V1 Games**: Original 3-location format (5 turns, identify 3 locations)
- **V2 Games**: Enhanced 3+1 format (7 turns, identify 3 locations + deduce 4th final location)

## Repository Status

- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/dev-zuma/places
- **Current Phase**: V2 Game System Implementation (COMPLETED)
- **Production Status**: Ready for deployment and user testing
- **Last Updated**: 2025-01-11
- **Interface**: Dual-format detective case file experience with V1/V2 game management

## Test Organization Guidelines

### Test File Organization
- Use `/tests/`, `/test-results/`, and `/test-artifacts/` for storing tests and related content
- Organize test files and artifacts systematically in these designated folders
