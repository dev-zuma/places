# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a newly created project directory that has not been initialized yet. The project appears to be intended for a Node.js application based on its location in the `nodejs/openai_projects` directory.

## Getting Started

Before development can begin, the project needs to be initialized. Common initialization steps might include:

1. `npm init` - Initialize a Node.js project
2. Choose and install a framework (React, Next.js, Express, etc.)
3. Set up TypeScript configuration if needed
4. Configure build tools, linting, and testing

## Development Notes

Once the project is initialized, this file should be updated with:
- Build and development commands
- Testing commands
- Code architecture overview
- Key dependencies and their purposes
