## Technical Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Case Card Spacing Not Working
**Problem**: CSS had `gap: 24px` but computed style showed `display: block` instead of `display: flex`
**Root Cause**: JavaScript was setting `casesContainer.style.display = 'block'` which overrode CSS `display: flex`
**Solution**: Changed JavaScript to `casesContainer.style.display = 'flex'`
**Result**: 24px gaps now working correctly

### Issue 2: Test Modal Timeout
**Problem**: Initial test had modal closing timeout issues
**Root Cause**: Timing issues with modal animations
**Solution**: Added appropriate wait times and improved test timing
